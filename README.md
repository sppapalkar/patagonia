Link to [Deployment](https://patagoniaapp.herokuapp.com/)  
Link to [Github Project](https://github.com/sppapalkar/patagonia)

## Home Page

The home page of the web application is its login page. You can either register a new physician account or you can login with proper credentials.


### Before you proceed :

- Default django superadmin is not setup.


### General Navigation Guidelines

Each physician will have his/her own account to add/modify/delete patients. 

On logging into a physician account using valid credentials, you will be redirected to patients dashboard where various operations can be performed on patients

Proper access control has been implemented, therefore patient pages are not accessible before login. One cannot access any unauthorized page simply by changing the urls.


### Local Setup Instructions:

To setup app on local create a virtual envoirnment for python-django. All requirments are listed in requirements.txt
